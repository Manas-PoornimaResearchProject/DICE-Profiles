# DICE-Profiles
UML profiles for the DICE project

# Contents

## com.masdes.dam.static.profile

This plugin reimplements the DAM profile available at https://bitbucket.org/mberenguer/masdes-downloads/wiki/Home, and unifies the type system, solving problems with the redefinition of MARTE datatypes.

## org.eclipse.uml2.uml

This plugin is a patched version of `org.eclipse.uml2.uml` that eases the generation of profiles based on Papyrus MARTE.
It is only required for generating the Ecore file that implements a UML profile.
